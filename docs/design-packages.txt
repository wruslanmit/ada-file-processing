    fileName_x1 => original file 

If the form parameter `shared=no' appears in the form string, the file can be opened or created with its own separate stream identifier, regardless of whether other files sharing the same external file are opened. The exact effect depends on how the C stream routines handle multiple accesses to the same external files using separate streams.

If the form parameter `shared=yes' appears in the form string for each of two or more files opened using the same full name, the same stream is shared between these files, and the semantics are as described in Ada Reference Manual, Section A.14.

Input is a trimmed and non-blank text file:

pkg-extract-tokens-perLine
split a data string in ada -- search google

UNSEEN
Split line into tokens based on "single white space" and "horizontal tab"

Transform all gcodes into NGC, instead of many programs use only one program for NGC
example G0 becomes G00
